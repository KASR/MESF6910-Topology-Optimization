The answer is no.
The strain(stress) results are not equal at shared nodes.
You can compare the results in the excel file.
For the same node shared by two different elements, the strains are not identical.
I use the same color marking some nodes which shared by two elements in the Strain_at_Node_Position and Stress_at_Node_Position.
And we can see that they are quite different. 

The reason: 

For the node in different position, the B matrix is different.
i.e.
Bleftbottom
-10	0	10	0	0	0	0	0
0	-10	0	0	0	0	0	10
-10	-10	0	10	0	0	10	0

Bleftupper
0	0	0	0	10	0	-10	0
0	-10	0	0	0	0	0	10
-10	0	0	0	0	10	10	-10


You can see that£º
the second row of Bleftbottom matrix means that the y direction strain is related to the element's leftbottom node y direction displacement and the element's leftupper node y direction displacement.

However, the second row of Bleftupper matrix means that the y direction strain is also related to the element's leftbottom node y direction displacement and the element's leftupper node y direction displacement.

If the node is shared by two elements, in one element it is left bottom node and in another element it becomes the left upper node.

The y direction strain can be the same only when the shared node's y direction displacement is the average of the two not shared left nodes' y displacement.for example the y displacement is liner along the left side of two elements.

This problem can be much harder to solve when the shared node is share by four elements.
