# MESF6910-Topology-Optimization
Projects and Assignments related to Topology Optimization

This repository is the assignments, Midterm and Final project of class MESF6910B Topology Optimization.
All the topic is in the frame of SIMP-Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization method, which proposed and modified by Ole Sigmund and 
his collegues in Technical University of Denmark.

The four assignments and Mitterm project are talking about 2D-dimension topology optimization cases.
The final project is related to 3D topology optimzation.
